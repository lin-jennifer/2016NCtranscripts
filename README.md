# 2016 Democrat and Republican National Convention Transcripts

## File names

Each file is named with the same format: `doc.lastname.txt` for the DNC and `roc.lastname.txt` for the RNC. First names will follow if there are multiple people with the same last name. 

The files will only contain the content of the speeches. Name identifiers are located on the filenames.

## Metadata Spreadsheets

Each convention has its own metadata spreadsheet that matches the speaker with the filename assigned, along with the day of the speech and the way the speech was delivered (speech or video).
